== Frequently Asked Questions ==
**Which browsers is this plugin compatible with?**

The Custom Share Button plugin is compatible with all browsers.

**Why does the Custom Share Button appear on the far right side of the post/page after inserting the shortcode?**

This is the default behavior. However, you can position the button at a custom location within the post/page without modifying the code. 
To do this, click the Plus icon to add a **Block**. Select **Row** from the options. 
Once this is added, choose **Add Block** from the left sidebar. 
Select **Shortcode**. After integrating it, paste the code **[custom_share_button]**. 
Now, under **Select Row**, you can choose the **Alignment of Elements** and customize the position of the button.
